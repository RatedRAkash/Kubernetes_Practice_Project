              #If you have 4 replicas of a Kubernetes deployment or pod, and each replica has the following resource limits:
              # CPU limit: "1000m" (1000 milliCPU or 1 CPU)
              # Memory limit: "1Gi" (1 Gibibyte)

              # Then, the total resource consumption for all 4 replicas will be the sum of the resource limits for each replica.

              # For CPU:
              # Total CPU limit: 4 replicas * 1000m = 4000 milliCPU = 4 CPU

              # For memory:
              # Total memory limit: 4 replicas * 1Gi = 4 Gibibytes
